## Rock Spawn Conditions
* Rocks may **only** spawn on grass and any diggable paths such as the dirt path, dark dirt path, and sand path.
* Rocks **cannot** spawn on non-diggable paths, custom designs, the beach, and any other location with spawn condition not met.
* Rocks can be blocked from spawning if it is within a blocker’s range. 
* A rock’s required spawn area, can overlap another rock’s required spawn area, as such, the **minimum distance between rocks is 1 tile**. 
* Rocks can all spawn within an acre. 

## Blockers
In order to force a rock to spawn where we want, we employ the use of blockers to prevent them spawning in places that we don’t want them to.

There are three main classes of blockers, that is:   
❶ [Single blocker](#single-blockers)   
❷ [Perimeter blocker](#perimeter-blockers)   
❸ [Obstruction blocker](#obstruction-blockers)       

### Single Blockers
These will only block their **own tile**. These blockers are typically those without a hitbox.

Examples include:
> * Dropped items
> * Flowers and weeds
> * Placed custom designs (on the ground)
> * Placed non-diggable paths
> * Dig spots

### Perimeter Blockers
Natural blockers (beach, water, cliffs), furniture or placed items typically only block a **perimeter of 1 tile** around the tiles they occupy. Generally, anything with a hitbox will be perimeter blockers. “Tall” furniture will be discussed in their own dedicated section.

Examples include:
> * Tiles adjacent to beach, water tiles, and cliff edges
> * Fences and placed items
> * Placed custom designs (mannequins & easels)
> * Placed furniture (exceptions being “tall” furniture)
> * Shrubs

While perimeter blockers only block 1 tile around them, there is a way to extend this by placing them on **half tiles**. The following visual shows the range that this blocks.

*The holes are there to give an indication of the tile boundaries. With the mannequin being in the half tile on 4 tiles, this essentially **extends the blocker range to be 4x4**, insetad of the usual 3x3. Take this into consideration when laying down blockers.*


### Obstruction Blockers
Obstruction blockers will block several tiles north of their occupying tiles. Buildings and cliffs will always block **4 tiles north**, while furniture's blocking size is dependant on their height, as will be explored in the [next section](#tall-furniture). It should be noted that these blockers can also block across multiple cliff levels.

Examples include:
> * Cliffs
> * Buildings (incl. inclines and bridges)
> * Trees
> * Placed “tall” furniture

## Tall Furniture
Furniture have height values and with this, it determines how far north a certain furniture will block rocks from spawning. **A list of the furniture heights** (courtesy of Zertolurian#9617) can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3hGAbli). Generally:

<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Height Value</th>
    <th class="tg-c3ow">Tiles Blocked</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">≥ 20</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">≥ 16</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">≥ 12</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">≥ 8</td>
    <td class="tg-c3ow">1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Trees
Trees are also considered "tall furniture", but only block **3 tiles north** of them. An exception to this is the **cedar** tree, where it blocks **4 tiles north** instead. 

Trees present another unique rule where they can also block an area of 3 tiles horizontally, 2 tiles north of their occupying tile. The illustration below compares the difference between cedar trees and other trees.

## Rock Garden Tips
1. Placed custom designs (mannequins and easels) are the easiest blockers to clean up. 
2. Perimeter blockers can be placed on half tiles to extend their blocking range.
3. Furniture/decorations can be placed after the rocks have spawned. 
4. For rocks that have not spawned where you wanted it to be, it could be that it has spawned elsewhere instead.
5. Use a toilet as an entrance to your rock garden to prevent breaking any rocks in the area.
